This project demonstrates a car driving game using OpenGL, GLM, stb_image, Bullet Physics and Assimp. It has a 
player-controlled car and procedural generated terrains using Perlin Noise.

1. List of dependencies

   OpenGL (using GLFW 3.4 with glad): rendering the scene.
   Bullet Physics: physics implementation.
   GLM: matrix and vector calculations.
   stb_image: loading images. 
   Assimp: loading 3D models.

2. How to run this?

   Make sure that all dependencies are installed and run CMakeLists.txt to create a build folder, then run the
   executable file inside the build folder. If you are in VSCode, you can install CMake Tools to build and dedug
